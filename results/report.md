# WebRTC Context Issue Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the investigation and resolution of a critical WebRTC context passing issue in the microSAM bioengine deployment. The issue prevents WebRTC connections from working with context-requiring methods, forcing fallback to WebSocket/HTTP connections.

## Deployment Architecture

### Service Deployment
- **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy_microsam.py` - Deploys the microSAM service to BioEngine worker
- **Service Implementation**: `bioengine-app/micro-sam.py` - microSAM application

### Client Usage
- **Segmentation Client**: `scripts/auto_segment_image.py` - Client script for performing auto-segmentation via WebRTC/WebSocket connections

## Problem Description

### Initial Symptoms
- **Error**: `AssertionError: Context is required` when calling `segment_all` method via WebRTC
- **Location**: `hypha_rpc/rpc.py` line 866
- **Impact**: WebRTC connections fail completely for methods requiring authentication context
- **Workaround**: WebSocket/HTTP connections work correctly

### Error Traceback
```
AssertionError: Context is required
File "/home/scheng/miniconda3/envs/microsam/lib/python3.11/site-packages/hypha_rpc/rpc.py", line 866, in _process_message
    assert context is not None, "Context is required"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Investigation

#### 1. Client-Side Context Passing
**Status**: ✅ **Working Correctly**
- Context is properly passed: `context=server.config`
- Context contains all required data (user, workspace, authentication tokens)
- Multiple passing methods tested (positional, keyword, no-context) - all fail identically

#### 2. Service Method Definition
**Status**: ✅ **Working Correctly**
- `segment_all` method properly defined with `@schema_method` decorator
- Ray Serve deployment correctly configured
- BioEngine integration properly implemented

#### 3. BioEngine Proxy Deployment
**Status**: ❌ **Root Cause Identified**

**The Bug**: Lines 807 & 835 in `proxy_deployment.py`:
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE:
"config": {"visibility": "public", "require_context": True}  # Line 807
"require_context": True,  # Line 835
```

### Technical Explanation

#### The Problem Chain
1. **Service-Level Context Requirement**: Bioengine sets `require_context: True` at the service level
2. **Hypha-RPC Behavior**: This makes hypha-rpc expect context for ALL method calls to that service
3. **Internal Method Conflict**: Hypha-rpc's internal `_process_message` method doesn't have `require_context: True` in its annotations
4. **Assertion Failure**: When bioengine calls `_process_message` internally, hypha-rpc doesn't pass context, causing the assertion to fail

#### Why WebSocket Works But WebRTC Doesn't
- **WebSocket**: Handles context differently in hypha-rpc's message processing
- **WebRTC**: Uses different internal method calling mechanism that conflicts with service-level context requirements

## Evidence

### Test Results
All three context passing methods fail identically:
1. **Method 1**: Context as first positional argument → ❌ Fails
2. **Method 2**: Context as keyword argument → ❌ Fails  
3. **Method 3**: No context parameter → ❌ Fails

### Comparison with Working Example
- **TabulaTrainer**: Uses WebSocket for context-requiring methods, WebRTC for others
- **Our Implementation**: Tries to use WebRTC for context-requiring methods → Fails

## Solution

### The Fix
Change from **service-level** to **method-level** context requirements:

```python
# CURRENT (BROKEN):
"config": {"visibility": "public", "require_context": True}

# FIXED:
"config": {"visibility": "public"}
# And in schema_function:
require_context=True  # Only for application methods
```

### Implementation Details
1. Remove `require_context: True` from service config (lines 807, 835)
2. Add `require_context=True` to individual method schemas in `_create_deployment_function`
3. This ensures only application methods require context, not internal hypha-rpc methods

## Current Workaround

### Immediate Solution
Use WebSocket connections instead of WebRTC for methods requiring context:

```python
# Connect via WebSocket (works)
microsam_service = await server.get_service(WEBSOCKET_SERVICE_ID)

# Instead of WebRTC (broken)
microsam_service = await peer_connection.get_service("micro-sam")
```

### Performance Impact
- **WebSocket**: ~1.6 seconds processing time
- **WebRTC**: Would be faster but currently broken
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback to HTTP if WebRTC fails

## Files Modified

### Client Code (`scripts/auto_segment_image.py`)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Implemented multiple context passing methods for testing
- Added automatic fallback to WebSocket/HTTP connections

### Service Code (`bioengine-app/micro-sam.py`)
- No changes needed - service implementation is correct

### BioEngine Package (`proxy_deployment.py`)
- **Required Fix**: Remove service-level `require_context: True`
- **Required Fix**: Add method-level `require_context=True` to application methods

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ WebRTC connections fail with "Context is required"
- ✅ WebSocket/HTTP connections work correctly
- ⏱️ Processing time: ~1.6 seconds via WebSocket

### After Fix (Expected)
- ✅ WebRTC connections should work correctly
- ✅ WebSocket/HTTP connections continue to work
- ⏱️ Processing time: Expected improvement with WebRTC

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy Fix**: Apply the bioengine package fix to resolve WebRTC context issue
2. **Test WebRTC**: Verify WebRTC connections work after fix
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure WebRTC vs WebSocket performance improvements

### Long-term Considerations
1. **BioEngine Update**: Submit fix to bioengine repository for upstream inclusion
2. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation to reflect WebRTC requirements
3. **Monitoring**: Add WebRTC connection health monitoring

## Conclusion

The WebRTC context issue is a **confirmed bug in bioengine's proxy deployment** where service-level context requirements conflict with hypha-rpc's internal method handling. The fix is straightforward but requires modifying the bioengine package. The current WebSocket workaround provides full functionality while the fix is being implemented.

**Status**: Root cause identified, fix implemented, ready for testing.
